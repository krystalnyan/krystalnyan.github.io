        <p>Hi! My name is Krystal and I am an international student from Myanmar. I love all things girly and pink. My favorite artists are Ariana Grande, SZA, Luh Kel and New Jeans. When I am not at school, you can find me cooking up new dishes or bingewatching the newest Kdrama! I love true crime podcasts and reading thriller books. I hope to have an amazing time in this decal and develop my web design skills.</p>
